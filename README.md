I store my own UNIX config files here.

## Install

This will create symlinks on your home directory and install Vundle plugins:

```
./install.sh
```

Optionally, you can create the following files to customize things locally:

* `~/.gitconfig.local`
* `~/.hgrc.local`
* `~/.vimrc.local`
* `~/.zsh/local`
